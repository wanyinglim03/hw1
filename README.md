This is the first version of the website I am creating for Lumos Helmet. The focus here is on the structure of the website rather than its aesthetics. There are 3 HTML pages, the Home page (index), About Us page (aboutus) and products page (products). 

Questions that I have: 
1. How to resize images?
2. How to add videos?
